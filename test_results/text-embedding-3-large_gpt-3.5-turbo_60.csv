What is the purpose of an API proxy in Apigee?,"An API proxy acts as an intermediary between client applications and backend services, providing security, rate limiting, and other management capabilities.","The purpose of an API proxy in Apigee is to act as a facade for one or more APIs, generic HTTP services, or applications. It decouples the developer-facing API from backend services, shielding developers from code changes and enabling innovation at the edge without impacting internal development teams. The API proxy isolates the app developer from the backend service, allowing you to make changes to the service implementation as long as the public API remains consistent. By maintaining a consistent frontend API, existing client apps will continue to work regardless of changes on the backend. Additionally, you can use policies on the API proxy to add functionality to a service without having to make changes to the backend service.",False
How can you make an API proxy accessible through multiple domain names,Use multiple <VirtualHost> elements within the <HTTPProxyConnection> element of the ProxyEndpoint configuration [our conversation].,"To make an API proxy accessible through multiple domain names, you can define multiple virtual hosts in your Edge environment. Each virtual host can specify different domains and ports on which the API proxy is exposed.

How do you define the base path for an API proxy? ,The base path is specified using the <BasePath> element within the <HTTPProxyConnection> of the ProxyEndpoint configuration [our conversation].,The base path for an API proxy is defined as the URI fragment that appears after the http(s)://[host] address of your API proxy. Edge uses the base path URI to match and route incoming request messages to the proper API proxy. The base path defaults to the value specified for the Proxy Name field converted to all lower case. You can also use one or more /*/ wildcards in API proxy base paths to future-proof your proxies.,False
How do you control the order in which policies are executed within a flow? ,The order of <Step> elements within a <Request> or <Response> section determines the policy execution order [our conversation].,"You control the order in which policies are executed within a flow by arranging them in a sequence of ""steps"" within that flow. By setting the order of policies within the flow, you can ensure that they are executed in the desired sequence to achieve your API proxy's goals.",True
What is the primary purpose of API product configuration in Apigee? ,"API products bundle APIs and make them available to app developers, controlling access and enforcing usage policies.","The primary purpose of API product configuration in Apigee is to bundle your APIs and make them available to app developers for consumption. API products act as your product line by bundling together a collection of API resources (URIs), service plans, and optional metadata specific to your business for monitoring or analytics. This allows you to create specialized feature sets by mixing and matching resources from one or more APIs to address specific use cases.",True

How do app developers obtain credentials to access APIs managed by Apigee,"Developers register their apps and are provided with API keys, which are associated with API products granting access to specific APIs.","App developers obtain credentials to access APIs managed by Apigee by registering their apps and choosing the APIs they want to use. Upon registration, developers receive unique API credentials (consumer keys and secrets) needed to access the APIs. These credentials, such as API keys, are then included in every request to the API proxy included in the API product. The key is authenticated, and if successful, the request is allowed to access the backend service. Developers can register their apps through the developer portal or an API provider can register apps on their behalf in Apigee.",True
What is the role of the Apigee runtime in API management?,"The Apigee runtime is responsible for executing API proxies, enforcing policies, and collecting analytics data.","The Apigee Edge API runtime plays a crucial role in API management by providing tools for creating, configuring, and managing API proxies. It allows you to add security, rate-limiting, mediation, caching, and other policies to your API proxies. Additionally, you can customize the behavior of your API proxies by applying custom scripts and making calls to third-party APIs. The API runtime also offloads common management concerns from your backend services, making it easier to manage and secure your APIs effectively.",True
What security mechanism does Apigee use to protect access to APIs? ,Apigee uses API keys and OAuth tokens for authentication and authorization to control access to APIs.,"Apigee Edge provides various security mechanisms to protect access to APIs, including OAuth 2.0 based authentication, API keys, and authorization mechanisms through API products. OAuth 2.0 is used for authentication, and API keys are provisioned for API products, not individual APIs. Additionally, Apigee enforces authorization at runtime to ensure that requesting apps have permission to access specific API resources and have not exceeded their quota.",True
How are API resources grouped and managed within Apigee,"API resources are bundled into API products, which define access levels, quotas, and other usage restrictions.","API resources are grouped and managed within Apigee using API products. An API product is a collection of API resources (URIs) combined with a quota or service plan. These API products are published to app developers at design time. API products can be bundled into API packages for monetization. Each API product can contain a set of API resources from one or more APIs, allowing for flexibility in creating specialized feature sets. Different properties, such as pricing levels, can be set on each API product. Developers register their client apps with specific API products, receive an API key for access, and make requests to services through API proxies bundled in the API product. API products are the central mechanism for authorization and access control to APIs within Apigee.",True
What is the function of quotas in API product management? ,"Quotas define limits on the number of requests allowed for a particular API product, helping protect backend systems from overload.","Quotas in API product management serve several functions:

1. Quotas can protect your backend servers from high traffic by limiting the number of requests that can be made through the API product.
2. Quotas can differentiate your product line by allowing you to offer different levels of access based on the quota limit set for each API product.
3. Quotas can help you bundle resources with different quota limits to create premium and basic product offerings.
4. Quotas can be referenced in quota policies to enforce restrictions on the number of calls that can be made through the product.
5. Quotas can be adjusted at runtime on an API product, and quota policies that reference the value will automatically have updated quota values.

In summary, quotas play a crucial role in managing access to your APIs, protecting your servers, and offering different levels of service to your customers.",True
What are OAuth scopes used for in Apigee? ,"OAuth scopes define the level of access granted to an API, allowing for fine-grained control over what resources and actions an app can perform.","OAuth scopes in Apigee are used as an added level of security. When defining an API product, you can specify OAuth scopes as a comma-separated list that must be present in access tokens sent through the product. These scopes help in defining the level of access or permissions that an application has when making API calls. It is essential to ensure that the scopes added to a product match existing scopes to maintain security.

Upon registration, developers receive a unique API key that they must include in their API requests to access the designated API products.",False
What are the key concepts to understand when creating API products?,"Key concepts include API keys, quotas, OAuth scopes, and access levels, all of which contribute to controlling and securing API access.","When creating API products, it is important to understand the following key concepts:

1. API keys: API keys are provisioned for API products, not for individual APIs. They act as request credentials and are associated with bundles of resources and service plans.

2. Automatic versus manual key approval: You can configure API products to require manual approval for key generation or have them automatically approved upon registration.

3. Quotas: You can set access limits on API products to control the number of requests that can be made within a specific timeframe.

4. OAuth scopes: If OAuth is used for authorization, you can define scopes in API products to control access to specific resources based on the access token presented by the app.

5. Access levels: API products allow you to control access to API resources based on different criteria, such as internal developers only, paying customers only, read-only access, or read/write access.

"How do API keys work in Apigee, and what role do they play in securing APIs?","When you register as a developer, Edge creates a consumer key and secret to identify requests. The app developer embeds the consumer key into their app, so that it’s included when the app makes requests to an API hosted by Edge. API keys are provisioned for API products as part of an app service plan. When an app attempts to access an API product, authorisation is enforced by Apigee at runtime to ensure that:
The app is permitted to access a particular API resource
The requesting app has not exceeded its permitted quota
If defined, the OAuth scopes defined in the API product match those associated with the access token presented by the app","In Apigee, API keys are provisioned for API products, which are bundles of resources with an attached service plan. When an app developer registers their app, they receive an API key that must be included in every request to an API proxy included in the API product. This key is authenticated, and if authentication is successful, the request is allowed to access the backend service. API keys play a crucial role in securing APIs by ensuring that only authorized apps with valid keys can access the API resources. Additionally, API keys help in enforcing access control, managing quotas, and verifying OAuth scopes to enhance security and control over API access.",True
"What are the different access levels available for API products in Apigee, and how do they control access to APIs?","When defining an API product in Apigee, there are three access levels: Public, Private and Internal only. These access levels determine which developers can use the API product.
Public API products are available to all developers and can be added to developer portals
Private and Internal only API products are only integrated and make them available to internal developers. There is no functional difference between the two; the label describes the intended audience
Note: Apigee recommends that you manage developer accounts directly on your developer portal. This ensures that the accounts are in sync","In Apigee, when defining an API product, you can set the following access levels:

1. Public: API products that are available to all developers. These can be added to integrated or Drupal-based developer portals.

2. Private: API products that can be accessed by internal developers only or by paying customers only.

These access levels control access to APIs by allowing you to set different properties on each API product. For example, you can create API products with different access limits, such as requests per day, and price points. This allows you to offer different levels of access to your APIs based on the needs of developers or customers.",False
Explain the role of environments (test and prod) in the Apigee API development lifecycle.,"Apigee Edge has at least two environments by default, test and prod. These provide segregation of data and resources. API proxies are created in the test environment which is typically used for promoting API proxies from development. Once ready, the proxy can be deployed to the prod environment which is used for deploying API proxies during the test environment","The environments in Apigee, specifically the ""test"" and ""prod"" environments, play a crucial role in the API development lifecycle.
