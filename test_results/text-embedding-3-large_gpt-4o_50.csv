What does an API proxy do?,"An API proxy intercepts requests from clients and directs them to the backend service, applying policies along the way.","An API proxy decouples the app-facing API from your backend services, shielding those apps from backend code by defining endpoints that include a URL with resource paths, an HTTP verb, body requirements, and so on. It acts as an interface to developers who want to use your backend services, allowing them to access the services through the API proxy rather than directly.",False
What is a common use case for setting different quota limits for API products,"Different quota limits can differentiate product tiers, offering higher limits for premium products.","A common use case for setting different quota limits for API products is to differentiate product lines. For example, you might offer one API product with a low access limit, such as 1000 requests per day, at a bargain price, and another with a higher quota as a premium product. This approach can help protect your backend servers from high traffic while also providing tiered access to your services.",True
Where do you add a policy in an API proxy configuration? ,Policies are added within the flows of a ProxyEndpoint or TargetEndpoint using <Step> elements,"In the management UI proxy editor, you add a policy in the Develop tab.",False
why is it important to attach a Quota policy to the request flow rather than the response flow?,"If you were to attach a Quota policy to the response flow, it would count the responses received from the backend service rather than the requests to the API proxy","Attaching a Quota policy to the request flow is important because it ensures that quota constraints are enforced before any other processing takes place. This means that if a request exceeds the quota, it can be immediately rejected, preventing unnecessary processing and resource usage. By enforcing quotas in the request flow, you can also ensure that security and quota policies are applied consistently and reliably, without the risk of a condition failing to evaluate in a later conditional flow.",False
How can you use Apigee to protect backend services from traffic spikes or overload?,Apigee can protect backend services from traffic spikes and overload by using a Quota policy.

"How do API keys work in Apigee, and what role do they play in securing APIs?","When you register as a developer, Edge creates a consumer key and secret to identify requests. The app developer embeds the consumer key into their app, so that it’s included when the app makes requests to an API hosted by Edge. API keys are provisioned for API products as part of an app service plan. When an app attempts to access an API product, authorisation is enforced by Apigee at runtime to ensure that:
The app is permitted to access a particular API resource
The requesting app has not exceeded its permitted quota
If defined, the OAuth scopes defined in the API product match those associated with the access token presented by the app","API keys in Apigee are used to authenticate and authorize access to APIs. They serve as a unique identifier for the client application making requests to the API. When a client application wants to access an API, it includes its API key in the request. The API proxy in Apigee then validates this key to ensure that the request is coming from a legitimate source. This process helps in securing APIs by ensuring that only authorized applications can access them. Additionally, API keys can be used to track and control how the APIs are being used, providing an extra layer of security and management.",False
"What are the different access levels available for API products in Apigee, and how do they control access to APIs?","When defining an API product in Apigee, there are three access levels: Public, Private and Internal only. These access levels determine which developers can use the API product.
Public API products are available to all developers and can be added to developer portals
Private and Internal only API products are only integrated and make them available to internal developers. There is no functional difference between the two; the label describes the intended audience
Note: Apigee recommends that you manage developer accounts directly on your developer portal. This ensures that the accounts are in sync","The different access levels available for API products in Apigee are Public, Private, and Internal only. These access levels control access to APIs by determining who can access the API resources within an API product. For example, you can set resources to be accessible only by internal developers or by paying customers. API keys are provisioned for API products, which serve as the central mechanism for authorization and access control to your APIs.",False
Explain the role of environments (test and prod) in the Apigee API development lifecycle.,"Apigee Edge has at least two environments by default, test and prod. These provide segregation of data and resources. API proxies are created in the test environment which is typically used for promoting API proxies from development. Once ready, the proxy can be deployed to the prod environment which is used for deploying API proxies during the test environment","In the Apigee API development lifecycle, environments play a crucial role in managing and deploying API proxies. Every organization using Apigee Edge is provisioned with at least two environments: ""test"" and ""prod.""

1. **Test Environment**: This environment is typically used for developing and testing API proxies. It allows developers to deploy and test their APIs in a controlled setting before they are ready for production. The test environment is essential for ensuring that the API functions correctly and meets all requirements before it is exposed to real users.

2. **Prod Environment**: The production environment is used for promoting API proxies that have been tested and are ready for live use. This environment is where the API is made available to end-users and where it must perform reliably and efficiently. The transition from the test environment to the prod environment is a critical step in the API development lifecycle, as it signifies that the API is ready for real-world application.

These environments help organizations manage the development and deployment process effectively, ensuring that APIs are thoroughly tested before being released to production.",True
How can you use variables to manage state and conditional logic within Apigee API proxies?,"You can access state data through flow variables created by API proxies. An API proxy has access to variables that represent its execution state. You can also access these variables from the XML that configures your API proxies and policies. These variables are held by Apigee Edge, some exist by default, while others can be created as a logic requirement. You can have API proxies execute conditionally. Just as in most programming languages, in an API proxy you can have code execute conditionally. Conditions are often based on API proxy state, which you can access through flow variables.","You can manage state and conditional logic within Apigee API proxies by using flow variables. Flow variables allow you to access and manipulate the execution state of an API proxy. You can create your own variables to satisfy specific logic requirements and use them to execute API proxies conditionally. Conditions are often based on the API proxy state, which can be accessed through these flow variables. For example, you can set a condition to check for the user agent and then process the request accordingly. Most logic in an API proxy is implemented using policies, which can leverage these flow variables for conditional execution.",True
"Describe the process of importing existing consumer keys and secrets into Apigee. What are the size limits for consumer keys and secrets, and why are they important?","You can import existing consumer keys and secrets into Apigee by using the management API. This is done one key at a time to avoid service disruptions. The size limits for consumer keys and secrets are 2 KB each. These limits help to prevent service disruptions. To import existing consumer keys and secrets, you would first create them in Edge with the management API, one at a time. Then, you would associate the consumer key and secret with one or more API products using the management API. Finally, you can optionally delete the initial consumer key and secret that Edge auto-generated. However, you can keep the auto-generated key because both the imported key and the auto-generated key work in API calls and are displayed on the Developer App Details page in the Management UI","The process of importing existing consumer keys and secrets into Apigee Edge involves recreating the keys and secrets from another system, rather than a direct import. The size limits for consumer keys and secrets are 2 KB each. These size limits are important to ensure that the keys and secrets are manageable and compatible with the system's requirements, maintaining performance and security standards.",False
What are the differences between an API proxy and an API product in Apigee?,"An API proxy is a façade for one or more web services that mediates access. It’s implemented as a set of configuration files, policies and code that rely on the services provided by the Apigee proxy. An API product is a collection of API resources that are combined with a quota, service plan and API packages for monetisation. Developers create API products to address use cases that solve specific needs, for example, they can create API products that bundle a number of mapping resources to enable developers to easily integrate maps into their applications","An API proxy in Apigee is the HTTP endpoint that developers use to access your backend services. It acts as an intermediary that decouples the app-facing API from your backend services, providing a layer of abstraction and protection for your backend code.

An API product, on the other hand, is a bundle of one or more API proxies combined with a service plan. This service plan can set access limits, provide security, allow monitoring and analytics, and offer additional services. API products are typically used to group API proxies together rather than making individual proxies available.",False

However, policies are used for access control, meaning they are used in implementing security. When creating API products, make sure to include the appropriate security policy in your API proxies, such as the Verify API Key or OAuth v2.0 policies. This ensures that only authorised clients can access your APIs.","Some security best practices to consider when developing and deploying APIs on Apigee include:

1. Use two-factor authentication for your Apigee account.
2. Include appropriate security policies in your API proxies, such as Verify API Key or OAuth v2.0.
3. Use API keys and/or OAuth access tokens to enforce API access.
4. Implement content-based security measures.
5. Mask and hide sensitive data.
6. Ensure last-mile security.",False
How do you use the Apigee management API to interact with Apigee resources programmatically? What type of authentication is needed?,"The Apigee management API has endpoints that require authentication using RESTful principles. You can send HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods to these endpoints. To use the management API, you need to authenticate your requests using one of the following methods:
○ OAuth2
○ SAML
○ Basic Auth (not recommended)
Apigee recommends using two-factor authentication",This question falls beyond my expertise.,False
Can you explain the process of registering app developers and managing their accounts in Apigee? What are the recommendations for managing developer accounts on developer portals?,"App registration provides the primary mechanism for controlling access to APIs. Developers can self-register through a developer portal, Drupal 10 or Drupal 7. Administrators can register developers using the Edge Management UI or API. Developers can also be registered through an app developed by the provider. When a portal user creates an account, an email address is generated. This serves as the primary key used by Edge to identify the developer.You can manage developer accounts using the Edge UI and Classic Edge UI by
○ Adding a developer
○ Viewing and editing developer details
○ Activating or deactivating a developer
○ Exporting publishing data
○ Deleting a developer
○ Searching the list of developers","Apigee recommends managing app developers directly on your developer portal rather than using Apigee Edge. Administrators can register app developers using the API, and as a developer portal administrator, you should manage developers directly on your portal. For more detailed guidance, you would need to refer to the specific sections on managing developers in the Apigee documentation.",False

Describe the role of the Apigee Edge UI and its key features for API proxy development.,"The Apigee Edge UI is a browser-based tool used to create, configure and manage proxies and products. It provides a graphical interface to perform tasks such as:
○ Creating API proxies
○ Creating products that bundle proxies for client requests
○ Managing developers and developer apps
○ Configuring test and production environments
○ Implementing Javascript and Node.js applications","The Apigee Edge UI is a browser-based tool used to create, configure, and manage API proxies and API products. It allows users to perform a variety of tasks related to API proxy development, although some tasks can only be accomplished using the API. The key features of the Apigee Edge UI include:

- Creating API proxies: Users can design and implement API proxies using the UI.
- Configuring API proxies: The UI provides tools to configure various aspects of API proxies, such as security, traffic management, and analytics.
- Managing API products: Users can manage API products, which are collections of API proxies that are exposed to developers.
- Transitioning from Classic Edge UI: The UI supports transitioning from the Classic Edge UI to the newer interface.

Overall, the Apigee Edge UI is a comprehensive tool for managing the lifecycle of API proxies and products.",False
