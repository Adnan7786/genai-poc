What is the correct XML configuration for a ProxyEndpoint that listens on both HTTP and HTTPS?,"To configure a ProxyEndpoint to listen on both HTTP and HTTPS, you need to include two <VirtualHost> elements within the <HTTPProxyConnection> section. One <VirtualHost> should have the value ""default"", representing the HTTP connection, and the other should have the value ""secure"", representing the HTTPS connection.
Here's an example of the configuration:
<HTTPProxyConnection>
  <BasePath>/weather</BasePath> 
  <VirtualHost>default</VirtualHost>
  <VirtualHost>secure</VirtualHost>
  <Properties/>
</HTTPProxyConnection>
This configuration ensures that the API proxy can accept requests over both HTTP and HTTPS. ","The correct XML configuration for a ProxyEndpoint that listens on both HTTP and HTTPS is as follows:

```xml
<HTTPProxyConnection>
